 * Briefly description for coordinates of chessboard from wiki:
 *
 * Each square of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate
 * pairâ€”a letter and a number. The vertical columns of squares, called
 * files, are labeled a through h from White's left (the queenside) to
 * right (the kingside). The horizontal rows of squares, called ranks,
 * are numbered 1 to 8 starting from White's side of the board.
